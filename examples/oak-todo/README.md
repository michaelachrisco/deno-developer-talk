All based on previous work here:
https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/create-a-todo-api-in-deno-written-by-a-guy-coming-from-node/
https://github.com/adeelibr/deno-playground

To be sure this works, I went through each of the patterns/code above.

Postgres repository and service pulled from: https://blog.logrocket.com/creating-your-first-rest-api-with-deno-and-postgres/
and modified to suit our needs.

to run: `deno run --allow-net server.ts`
